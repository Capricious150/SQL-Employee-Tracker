  ## Description 
  A command-line application that uses SQL, mysql2, Inquirer, and console.tables to manage, update and view departments, roles, and employees at a theoretical business. Features a salary-budget calculator and a user friendly interface (in so far as a command-line application can have that). This is intended to function as a DEMO MIMIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT and is lacking a number of features that would be included in a larger application of its type. For instance, this iteration of the program does not feature DELETE options from the database, nor can ROLES be updated, etc.
